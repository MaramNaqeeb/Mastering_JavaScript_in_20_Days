# Day1: Introduction & DOM
This file gives an overview of what JavaScript is, and how to write codes on the browser's JS console to interact with the DOM using CSS selectors in order to retrieve some info from the DOM and make some changes to the DOM.

## What is JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that interact with HTML to do some stuffs on web pages.
JavaScript is a dynamic language in which it is not directly associated with a specific data type, so that we can declare variables without specifying a certain data type to them, and we can re-assign variables to values of different data types. Also, JavaScript is a just-in-time language in that it compiles the code and meanwhile it optimizes and interprets the code.   Moreover, JavaScript is a weakly-typed language as it makes a type conversion when a mismatch happens between operations without running an error. For example, if we add a string to a number, JS converts the number to a string without running an error.

## BFFs (HTML, CSS, JS)
HTML is about the content and the structure of the web elements. 

CSS is about the positioning and designing the web elements.

JS is about the actions of the web element. 

## Where to write and run JS code:
We can write JS code on the browserâ€™s JS console, the local text file such as TextEdit or VS code, or online playground such as CodePen or CodeSandBox.

## What is DOM 
DOM is a shortcut of Document Object Model in which JS creates an object model or entity that represents the HTML Document with its content and elements.

### Note If we type document in the console, we get all the values and stuffs that represents HTML document to JS.
