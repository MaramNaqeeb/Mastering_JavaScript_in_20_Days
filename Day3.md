# Arrays and Variables
In this file, I will define what array is and what methods we can use to deal with arrays.

Also, I will demonstrate the differences between arrays and strings, let and const, and between push and concat.

## Arrays  
An array can be defined as keep multiple values together in a single collection(list).
#### Example:
``` let fruits=[“orange”,”apple”, “strawberry”] ```

``` .length ``` is used  get the number of the element in an array.

``` .indexOf() ``` is used to get the index number of the first occurance of a specific element in an array.

``` [index] ``` To access a particular value in an array we use the index of the value in querly brackets 

## Methods with Arrays

- ``` .includes() ``` to search for a value in the array 
#### Example 
``` fruits.includes(“orange”) ```   the output: true

- ``` .pop() ``` to remove the last item in an array
  #### Example
  An array can be defined as keep multiple values together in a single collection(list).
#### Example:
``` let fruits=[“orange”,”apple”, “strawberry”] ```
 ``` let lastItem=fruits.pop() ``` "strawberry" will be removed

 - ``` .push() ``` to add an item to the end of an array
 - 
#### Example:
``` let fruits=[“orange”,”apple”, “strawberry”] ```
 ``` let lastItem=fruits.pop("banana") ``` "banana" will be added
