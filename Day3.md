# Arrays and Variables
In this file, I will define what array is and what methods we can use to deal with arrays.

Also, I will demonstrate the differences between arrays and strings, let and const, and between push and concat.

## Arrays  
An array can be defined as keep multiple values together in a single collection(list).
#### Example:
``` let fruits=[“orange”,”apple”, “strawberry”] ```
``` .length ``` is used  get the number of the element in an array.
``` .indexOf() ``` is used to get the index number of the first occurance of a specific element in an array.
``` [index] ``` To access a particular value in an array we use the index of the value in querly brackets
